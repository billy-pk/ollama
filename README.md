Streamlit RAG Application using DeekSeek-r1:1.5b running locally, based on Langchain framework

This repository contains a Streamlit application that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on a provided PDF document.

**Key Features:**

RAG Architecture: The application employs a RAG architecture, combining information retrieval with a language model.

DeekSeek-r1:1.5b Model: The core of the RAG system is the DeekSeek-r1:1.5b language model, a powerful large language model known for its strong reasoning capabilities. 

_DeekSeek-r1 excels at_:


Understanding and interpreting complex information: It can effectively process and comprehend the contents of the PDF document, including intricate concepts and nuanced language.

Drawing inferences and making connections: DeekSeek-r1 can go beyond simple keyword matching and identify deeper relationships between different parts of the document to provide more insightful answers.

Generating human-like text: The model produces coherent and informative responses that are easy for users to understand.

Ollama: The application runs locally using Ollama, a framework for running large language models on your machine.

PDF Document Upload: Users can upload a PDF document to the application.

Querying and Answering: The application allows users to input a query related to the uploaded PDF, and the RAG system retrieves relevant information and generates a concise answer.

Ollama Embeddings with DeekSeek-r1: Ollama embeddings are used to efficiently represent the PDF document and user queries, enabling fast and accurate information retrieval.
